## Notion for Dev Learners

> This article assumes you're familiar with the basics of using Notion -> Creating a new notion page and adding blocks. Don't worry if you aren't! Just go through the first four minutes of [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA7si7AmPkY)

# Introduction
Notion is a note-taking and project management tool that has amassed huge popularity in recent years. It's quite flexible, allowing one almost complete freedom in customizing a page. Because of the ability to add images, databases, tables, and code blocks, and a multitude of integrations with popular web services, Notion is a great tool for developers to take notes on their learning journey.

#### A few advantages over traditional note-taking
1. It's on the cloud - access the notes anywhere, anytime.
2. Ridiculously fast - copying code snippets, highlights from documentation, saving screenshots - everything is faster than the manual route.
3. Third-Party Integration - embedding a Pen from CodePen , a GitHub gist, a Deepnote block, or a drawing from Excalidraw, Notion has a huge list of supported third-party services that can be integrated with it and the list keeps on growing.

## Note-taking with Notion
Notion supports a plain-text formatting syntax called Markdown. Markdown is quite popular on blogging and writing platforms. In fact, I'm using Markdown here on Hashnode as I write this article. With markdown, it's easy to add headings, ordered lists, unordered lists, and code snippets.

We can use a mix of markdown and notion-specific shortcuts to make note-taking easy and fast.

### Headings

Add headings by typing `# followed by space`. The number of `#`s denote what type of heading it is - Heading 1, 2, or 3. If you know HTML and the h1-h6 heading styles, this is its plain-text version.
  * `#` - Heading 1
  * `##` - Heading 2
  * `###` - Heading 3

### Bold & Italics

  * To make text **bold**, add a pair of asterisks or underscores before and after the text.

  * To make text *italic*, add one asterisk or underscore before and after the text.

  * To make a text ***both bold and italic***, add three asterisks before and after the text.

Alternatively, you can select text and hit`ctrl/cmd + b` to make text bold and `ctrl/cmd + i` to make text italic.

### Code & Code Blocks
To mark text as code add backticks before and after the text(The key above the tab key -> \`). Alternatively, select the text and hit `ctrl/cmd + e` to mark it as code.

To add a code block, type `three backticks followed by space`. The code block element will be embedded and the language can be selected from the dropdown list at the top-left.

### Text Coloring
To color text, add a forward slash followed by the color name. Notion supports both text color and text background color from a list of preset colors.

Alternatively, select the text that needs to be colored and click on `A` from the toolbar that appears to select the required from the color picker dropdown list. To use the most recently used color, hit `ctrl/cmd + h` Text marked as code and that in code blocks can be colored this way.

### Ordered and Unordered Lists
To add an ordered list type the number from which the list must start followed by a period and space i.e. `number.<space>`

To add an unordered list type an asterisk followed by a space i.e. `*<space>`

Hit the tab key to nest lists

### Checklist
To start a checklist type `[]`. Hitting the enter key will continue the checklist. Hitting it twice will stop the list.

### Inserting Files
**Images:**
Screenshots copied to clipboards can be simply pasted in Notion and they will be embedded in your page (` Windows key + Shift + S` on Windows and `Shift +Command + 4` on Mac)

To insert image files directly from your computer or from the web, type `/image` and select the image block from the dropdown list. Notion will then display a dialog box giving the option to upload an image, embed a link, or pick an image from Unsplash.

**General Files:**
To upload a PDF type `/PDF` and select the PDF block. 
To upload a general file type `/File` and select the File block.
In both instances, Notion will then display a dialog box giving the option to upload a file or embed a link.

### Callouts
Callouts are special blocks in Notion that are handy to make content stand out. They can be added by typing `/Callout`

## Conclusion
That wraps up all of the blocks you'll need on your note-taking journey on Notion. Remember, Notion has a lot more on offer than what I've explained above. Just hit the `/` key to see all the blocks and integrations that Notion has to offer. I'm on the journey of unpacking Notion myself and will be updating this article as I learn more :)
